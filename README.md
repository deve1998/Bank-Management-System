# Simple Banking System

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C%2B%2B-blue.svg)

A console-based banking application developed in C++ by Group 5 for a university project. This program simulates basic banking functionalities and demonstrates core programming concepts like data structures, file I/O for data persistence, and user interaction.

------------------------------------------------------

üöÄ Key Features

Based on the project requirements, the following features are implemented:

- 1. Account Creation: Allows a new user to create a bank account with their name and an initial deposit.
- 2. Deposit and Withdraw: Enables the user to deposit funds into their account and withdraw funds, with checks for sufficient balance.
- 3. Check Balance: Provides the user with their current account balance at any time.
- 4. Save and Load Account: The application saves the user's account details to a local file (`C:\Users\PC\Downloads\38833FF26BA1D.UnigramPreview_g9c9v27vpyspw!App`).
- 5. Account Persistence:** The program automatically detects and loads an existing account when it starts. If no account is found, it prompts the user to create one.
